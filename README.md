3. Able to handle large database and store large number of images for training
4. Network connectivity is not required which result to no network related problems

<a id="usage"></a>

## üé© Usage

1. Run the below command in the terminal to open the interface:
```sh
python3 train.py
```
2. For first time user/registration, enter the `ID`, `Name` and click on `Take Images` to take multiples images one-by-one.
3. For confirmation, we are shown the details entered in `Notification`.
4. Click on `Train Images` to train your captured image you just took in Step2.
5. Once registered, you can now `Track Images` to take-up the attendance and store it in database (here excel).
6. For confirmation, we are shown the details captured in `Attendance`.

Now, you are ready to use the software.
