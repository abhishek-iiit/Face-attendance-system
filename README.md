Their have been some drastic improvements in last few years in Image Recognition which has made it so much popular that now it is being widely used for commercial purpose as well as security purpose also.Tracking a users presence is becoming one of the problems in today’s world, so an attendance system based on facial recognition can act as a real world solution to this problem and add great heights of simplicity for tracking a users attendance.The manual entering of attendance in logbooks becomes difficult and takes a lot of time also, so I have designed an efficient module that comprises of face recognition using LBPH algorithm(OpenCV) to manage the attendance records of employee or students. During enrolling of a user, we take multiple images of a user along with his/her id/roll number and name also.The presence of each student/employee will be updated in database, and the user can check their attendance on the webpage also. The results showed improved performance over manual attendance system.

Here,I have used various python libraries and modules for face recognition, face identification, saving a users image and other information also.Along with that OPEN-CV(Open Source Computer Vision) library for face recognition, identification,and pandas package to store student information in local database,Numpy is used to perform the appropriate task,Tkinter helps us to make GUI for better interaction with the program.
